LetterOpend
===========

Scripts and Functions that let you peek at letterboxd films.

Sadly, with no API publicly available, this is a quick-hack way of peeking at the films that you and your friends have seen, listed, or watchlisted on letterboxd.com

This is not associated with letterboxd, nor is it guaranteed to work once an official API is released
